Please read this:-

This script I have written for my enviornment,  it wont be same as what you have. You have to change the paramaeter accordingly. 

The USB storage device for me is "/mnt/bkp/" and after mounting it  I have created a dir "alfdailybackup" 

I have avoided mounting the USB device using 'fstab' entry, this is because some time there are chances that USB drive is detached and the machine when booted up,  will have problem
