Please read this:-

This script I have written for my enviornment,  it wont be same as what you have. You have to change the paramaeter accordilgly. 

The USB storage device for me is "/mnt/bkp/" and after mounting it  I have created a dir "alfdailybackup" 

I have avoided mounting the USB device using 'fstab' entry, this is because some time when the machine is booted up, it will have problem if the USB is detached from the machine
